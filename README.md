Through this project, our team was able to build a project addressing a social issue, in particular homelessness and food scarcity. We implemented the functionality of a donation webpage connecting to an inventory website for authorized users to track and store their donations. Through the use of React.js, Python, and Django, we built an inventory management system from scratch. The implementation of Django forms, authorization, and handling quantity alerts using Django messages, allowed us to ensure users had accounts with maximum security and implemented login, logout, and fully functional edit/delete items to the inventory. The inventory's categories consist of the user's name, quantity, and the category of donation. 

Through this project, we were able to comprehensively provide a nonprofit an entire system aiming to assist the homeless through a webpage direct donation deposits and a resource inventory management system, and observe its real-world application in real-time.
